Cryptocurrency is kinda like an in-game currency for a blockchain. It exists solely to motivate miners to maintain the integrity of the system. If people were willing validate transaction for free there would be no need to have cryptocurrency, except when the entire point of this distributed application is to trade this resource.

If bitcoin is an in-game currency for the game where all you do is trade bitcoin, token are even more specialized and nebulous.
