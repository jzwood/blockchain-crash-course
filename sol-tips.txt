Function Visibility Specifiers

  public: visible externally and internally (creates a getter function for storage/state variables)
  private: only visible in the current contract
  external: only visible externally (only for functions) - i.e. can only be message-called (via this.func)
  internal: only visible internally

Modifiers

  pure for functions: Disallows modification or access of state - this is not enforced yet.
  view for functions: Disallows modification of state - this is not enforced yet.
  payable for functions: Allows them to receive Ether together with a call.
  constant for state variables: Disallows assignment (except initialisation), does not occupy storage slot.
  constant for functions: Same as view.
  anonymous for events: Does not store event signature as topic.
  indexed for event parameters: Stores the parameter as topic.
