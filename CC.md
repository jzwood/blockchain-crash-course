# Smart contracts

- we've talked about blockchain in the context of bitcoin, but how do you use blockchains to run decentralized web applications?
- limitations
  - I think about them as clockwork machines. Smart contracts can't actually do anything on their own.

Examples:
- tasks as simple as 'transfer the funds in 10 minutes' is impossible for a smart contract to do on its own.
You pull a level, it does a thing. If you really need some event to happen in the future either you need to tell the contract to do it yourself when it needs to do it or you need to implement some incentives system to convince a stranger to "pull the level" at the appropriate time.

- Store any private variables. (the blockchain is radically public)
